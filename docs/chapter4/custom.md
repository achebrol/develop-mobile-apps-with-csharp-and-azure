# Custom Authentication

The final category of authentication methods covers a wide variety of possibilities - custom logic.  This includes:

* Completely custom UI for username and password sign-in / sign-up.
* Using the social provider SDK to do authentication.
* Passwordless techniques (SMS authentication).
* Secure storage of credentials with biometric unlock.

In this section, we'll take a look at the possibilities for doing each of these, and do a sample implementation where it makes sense.
